iPad app for letting people know when I brought my own lunch to work

This is a full screen twitter client for the very specific task of indicating wheather or not I made a brown bag lunch today.  It mostly serves as an experiment with different ways of using RESTKit.  I intend on using some of the techniques that I have been hashing out in my head for a better way to deal with complex APIs and RESTKit.

## Features

This app will show the latest tweet belonging to @DidRyanMakeFood very large in the center of the screen.  It will then show any interactions that account has had with other users scrolling beneath it.

Any errors that occur during running should be silent in the background but show a small indicator on the screen that will reveal what the problem was when tapped.
